                            <p>First meeting to work on Milestone 3. The meeting took place at the Booth Building from 7:30PM
                                to 9PM. All team members were present.
                            </p>
                            <p>First, we summarized all the interviews that we did and gave the subjects code names.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Matthew’s subjects: M1 and M2</li>
                                <li>Aish’s subjects: A1, A2, and A3</li>
                                <li>Sovantharith’s subjects: S1, S2, and S3</li>
                                <li>Peter’s subjects: P1, P2, and P3</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We then came up with the roles and grouped the subjects to those roles. (STEP 1)</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Role 1: Person who initiate the voting process for a group. (S2, P2, A2)</li>
                                <li>Role 2: Person who participate in the voting process for a group. (S1, S3, P1, P3, A2, A3, A1)</li>
                                <li>Role 3: Person who prefer to order/eat out alone (A1)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We then identify the behavioral variables (STEP 2). We decided to pair the variables into
                                sliding scales
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Frequency of ordering out</li>
                                <li>How well can they handle orders?</li>
                                <li>How do they feel about making decisions?</li>
                                <li>Phone ordering vs online ordering</li>
                                <li>Quick decisions vs Fair decisions</li>
                                <li>Order for themselves vs Ordering as a group</li>
                                <li>Tech savvy</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>We then mapped the interview subjects to the behavioral variables. (STEP 3)</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>October 17th, 2017</h4>
                        <p>
                            We rewrote the behavioral pattern scales for a cleaner starting point. Then, we proceeded to
                            identify significant behavior patterns (STEP 4).The followings are the clusters that we found.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>S1 and P1</strong>: Do not go out often, are okay with remembering multiple orders,
                                prefer to order online and having a fair discussion, prefer to eat/order alone, and they
                                are comfortable with technology.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>S2, P2, and S3</strong>: Go out often, are good with remembering multiple orders,
                                like to make decisions that are quick, and prefer to eat/order as a group.</li>
                            <li><strong>A1, A3, and P3</strong>: Do not go out often. Are okay with decision making, make
                                decision that is a compromise between quick and fair, and are comfortable with technology.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We then synthesize the characteristics and define their goals. (STEP 5)</p>
