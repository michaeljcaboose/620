				<div class="milestone-item">
					<h3>Stakeholders</h3>
					<h4>Primary User</h4>
					<p>Large group of food enthusiast</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="milestone-item">
					<h3>Identify the problem</h3>
					<p>Going through physical menu brochures, apps and websites for price comparisons and for consensus to what is to be ordered and for whom.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="milestone-item">
					<h3>Identify the general solution</h3>
					<p>A web based service for browsers and phones to help the users come to a consensus regarding the type of order along with the place of choice and budget, it also aids the users by visualizing unfamiliar dishes that they might be interested in. </p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="milestone-item">
					<h3>Scope of the project</h3>
					<p>This project is for the creation of the interactive mobile application.  The application will be used for both iPhone and Android phones.  The user interface will be designed a part of the project, but will contain the ability to view the interactive menu and calculate the total of the food.  In addition, there will be a web application whereby anyone can use the app to view the interactive menu.  The application will have a tutorial to get it started.</p>
					<p>The service should work as a democratic filter for almost all platforms that precedes common food ordering services, it might or might not be able to also place the order but shall leave the users with the most apt place they should order from.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="milestone-item">
					<h3>Identify stakeholders</h3>
					<div>
						<h4>Stakeholders</h4>
						<p>Anyone who uses phone apps or the internet to order food, focus is on groups but can be used by individuals as well</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h4>Goals</h4>
						<p>To design an interactive system that breaks down detailed menu information to a minimal text and visual representation for quicker decision making.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h4>Worries</h4>
						<p>The task of ordering food in large groups with varying choices and opinions is both time consuming and strenuous. People tend to engage in quick questions or even democratic decisions on what to order and what not to, many a times, the place might not be of expectations or might not cater to dietary preferences</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h4>Ideas</h4>
						<p>Our design aims to kick in at the stage of decision making, making it swifter and more sorted for everyone, all they have to do is answer three questions - about the people they are with, the kind of food they wish for and their dietary preferences, our app takes all the answers and gives them the best common ground to order from.  They can see the condiments of the dish they are ordering.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h4>How to involve them</h4>
						<p>Ask the users for the feedback on the prototypes, participate the interview about what do they want to see and want to add on the prototypes</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h4>How to communicate the design</h4>
						<p>Share our low-fi and high-fi prototypes once they are available.  We ask the users for their feedback on the prototypes.  We ask them to look at existing fast food brands and food ordering apps for the kind of structure and color scheme they use.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h4>How to communicate progress</h4>
						<p>We share the updated prototypes once we get feedback from the users.  We follow up with the emails about the new updates.</p>
					</div>
					
				</div>	
				
				<div class="milestone-item">
					<h3>General Approach</h3>
					<p>We will be starting off with interviews and surveys to gather some insight into people’s behavior and  expectations while ordering food. The system needs to also function when only a few people in the gathering have the application thereby making it unnecessary for the newcomers to waste time signing up for/downloading it. This application would not force subscription upon users who do not know of it, instead it will introduce itself to the user when they receive their friend’s phone to enter their preferences.</p>

					<h3>Specify grounds of expulsion</h3>
					<p>Misses 2 meetings without providing an upfront explanation.</p>
					<p>Does not provide any contributions to projects</p>
					<p>Plagiarize someone’s project.</p>
